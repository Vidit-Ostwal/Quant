        "### **One-period Binomial Pricing Model** is one of the simplest financial  model to understand. A brief discription about this is given below:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   We call the beginning of the period time zero and the end of the period time one At time zero, we have a stock whose price per share we denote by `S0`, a positive quantity known at time zero\n",
        "*   At time one, the price per share of this stock will be one of two\n",
        "positive values, which we denote `S1(H) and S1(T)`, the H and T standing\n",
        "for head and tail, respectively\n",
        "*   Thus, we are imagining that a coin is tossed, and the outcome of the coin toss determines the price at time one. We do not assume this coin is fair (i.e., the probability of hea.d need not be one-half)\n",
        "*   We assume only that the probability of head, which we call `p`, is positive, and the probability of tail, which is `q = 1 - p`, is also positive\n",
        "*  u is the up-factor and d is the down-factor \n",
        "*  We also introduce interest rate` r`.  One dollar invested in the money\n",
        "market at time zero will yield `1 + r `dollars at time one. And we are assuming that the rate of borrowing is same as the rate of investing\n",
        "\n",
